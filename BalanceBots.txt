You find a factory where robots are passing microchips to each other. Each robot needs two microchips to proceed. 
Once it has two, it gives one to another robot or puts it in an output bin. Some robots also take microchips from input bins.

Each microchip has a number, and robots follow specific instructions to decide what to do with each chip. 

You download the instructions:

value 5 goes to bot 2
bot 2 gives low to bot 1 and high to bot 0
value 3 goes to bot 1
bot 1 gives low to output 1 and high to bot 0
bot 0 gives low to output 2 and high to output 0
value 2 goes to bot 2


Initially, bot 1 has a value-3 chip, and bot 2 has value-2 and value-5 chips. Bot 2 gives the lower chip (2) to bot 1 and the higher chip (5) to bot 0. 
Bot 1 then gives the value-2 chip to output 1 and the value-3 chip to bot 0. Finally, bot 0 puts the value-3 chip in output 2 and the value-5 chip in output 0.

In this setup, bot 2 compares the value-5 and value-2 chips.

Now, determine which bot is responsible for comparing the value-61 and value-17 microchips.
