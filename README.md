# Technical Requirements
Use programming language of your choice

# Challenge
Using the Balance Bots input file, find the number of the bot that is responsible for comparing value-61 microchips with value-17 microchips.


# Example:

## Instructions:
```
value 2 goes to bot 1
value 3 goes to bot 1
bot 1 gives low to output 0 and high to output 1
```
## Simulation:
```
Bot 1 receives chips 2 and 3.
Bot 1 gives the lower chip (2) to Output 0.
Bot 1 gives the higher chip (3) to Output 1.
```
## Final State:
```
Output 0: 2
Output 1: 3
```
Find the bot responsible for comparing the values 2 and 3. Bot 1 receives both chips and then distributes them to the outputs. The answer is Bot 1.


# Criteria
The winner is the first person to submit their code with the correct answer
